	<h2>Taste It</h2><hr>

		<p>
			I have always had a great interest and relationship with food. When I was only 10 years old I scrambled together a hand made cook-book for my nannas birthdays.
			And since then I have developed a deep relationship with food and what makes our taste buds dance. This is the main reason why I started this blog, to gain and share
			my knowledge and tips regarding food.
